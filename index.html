            <h1>Cut Through the AI Noise</h1>
            <p class="subtitle">Strategic AI advisory for organizations ready to move<br>past the hype and make smart technology decisions.</p>
            <p>The AI landscape is crowded, confusing, and full of vendors selling solutions to problems you may not have. Before you invest in tools, you need clarity on what AI can actually do for your organization - and what it can't.</p>

                    <h3>Understand Your Options</h3>
                    <p>The AI market moves fast. New tools launch weekly. Vendors overpromise. We help you cut through the noise with an honest assessment of what's available, what's mature, and what actually fits your use cases.</p>

                    <h3>Plan Before You Build</h3>
                    <p>AI isn't a project - it's a capability. We work with leadership teams to develop practical AI roadmaps: identifying opportunities, assessing readiness, and sequencing initiatives so you build momentum without betting the farm.</p>

                    <h3>Adopt AI Responsibly</h3>
                    <p>AI brings new questions about data privacy, intellectual property, bias, and security. We help you establish governance frameworks and acceptable use policies - so you move forward with confidence, not liability.</p>

            <h2>Why Torvity</h2>
            <div class="why-content">
                <p>I'm not here to sell you software or implement systems. I'm here to help you think clearly about AI - before you sign contracts or launch pilots that go nowhere.</p>
                <p>With 20+ years leading technology strategy in enterprise and association environments, I understand both the technical possibilities and the organizational realities: budget constraints, stakeholder alignment, change management, and the gap between what vendors promise and what actually ships.</p>
                <div class="quote">
                    "The right AI strategy isn't about adopting the latest tools. It's about knowing which problems are worth solving - and which solutions are worth your investment."
